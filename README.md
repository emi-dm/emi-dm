## 👋 Hi! I'm Emilio Delgado

### 🧑‍🔬 AI Researcher for Healthcare & Software Engineering

I'm a researcher and PhD student at the University of Extremadura, specializing in Machine Learning and Deep Learning applied to healthcare. My work focuses on processing and analyzing large-scale clinical and medical imaging data, aiming to improve quality of life and health outcomes through advanced AI.

Lately, I'm also diving deep into the world of **intelligent agents in software engineering** — because if code could think, it should at least help write itself (or refactor that mess you left in `utils.py` 😅).
